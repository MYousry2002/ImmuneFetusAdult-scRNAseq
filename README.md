# ImmuneFetusAdult-scRNAseq
This repository contains scRNAseq data comparing fetal and adult immune cells. Fetal samples include thymus and spleen, while adult samples focus on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The project explores developmental and functional differences in immune cells across these stages.
